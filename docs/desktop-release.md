# Desktop build and release

九格智能体平台 keeps Web and desktop sources on `main`. The desktop application is a
thin Electron shell around the same gateway and Web UI; desktop-specific runtime
behavior is enabled only when Electron sets `PILOTDECK_DESKTOP=1`.

## Web compatibility

- The existing root and `ui` build commands remain the source of the Web build.
- Docker installs only the root and UI workspace dependencies, so Electron and
  its native packaging dependencies are not installed in the Web image.
- Browser deployments never receive the Electron preload bridge.
- Desktop runtime files live under `apps/desktop` and are ignored by the Docker
  build context.
- Desktop runtime production dependencies use the dedicated manifest and frozen
  lockfile under `apps/desktop/runtime`; Web installs do not include this package.

Pull requests that touch shared, UI, Docker, or desktop code run the Web
regression workflow. Desktop-related pull requests also compile and test the
desktop shell.

The Web test job temporarily excludes `ui/e2e/**` (Playwright tests are not
Vitest tests) and the upstream `streamSmoother.test.ts` fake-timer test. Both are
known baseline failures; all other UI/server tests remain in the merge gate.

## Daily release policy

`.github/workflows/desktop-release.yml` runs every day at 02:00 Asia/Shanghai
(18:00 UTC on the previous calendar day). It compares `main` with the commit in
the latest desktop release tag:

- no production change: skip the release;
- production change: build signed and notarized macOS arm64 and x64 installers
  plus an unsigned Windows installer, then publish one dated GitHub Release;
- repeated manual release on the same date: use `-r2`, `-r3`, and so on.

Release tags are `desktop-vYYYY.MM.DD`. The internal Electron version is a
numeric SemVer derived from the same Shanghai date. GitHub Actions may also be
started manually with an optional release revision.

Every release contains architecture-specific macOS DMGs, the Windows installer,
`desktop-release.json`, and `SHA256SUMS`. The desktop updater ignores unrelated
Web/server releases, considers only tags beginning with `desktop-v`, and selects
the installer matching the current machine architecture.

Release publishing and packaged updater metadata use the repository running the
workflow. Production builds from upstream `main` therefore publish to and check
`OpenBMB/PilotDeck`; fork workflows remain isolated to their own repository.

## Required GitHub Secrets

Release builds deliberately fail when macOS code signing or notarization is
unavailable. Windows packaging remains explicitly unsigned, matching the
existing `desktopdev` release behavior.

macOS:

- `MACOS_DEVELOPER_ID_APPLICATION_P12_BASE64`
- `MACOS_DEVELOPER_ID_APPLICATION_PASSWORD`
- `APPLE_ID`
- `APPLE_APP_SPECIFIC_PASSWORD`
- `APPLE_TEAM_ID`
- `MACOS_KEYCHAIN_PASSWORD` (optional)

The macOS jobs run in parallel on GitHub's Apple Silicon `macos-latest` and
Intel `macos-15-intel` images. Each job fails early when the runner architecture
does not match its installer, and verifies the Electron executable, bundled
Node.js, and native runtime modules before uploading the DMG.

The macOS certificate must be a Developer ID Application certificate. The
Windows installer does not require a signing certificate. GitHub's automatic
`GITHUB_TOKEN` is used to publish the Release.

## Manual builds

```bash
pnpm install --frozen-lockfile
pnpm --filter 9gclaw-desktop test
# Run the command matching the Mac host architecture:
pnpm --filter 9gclaw-desktop dist:mac:arm64
pnpm --filter 9gclaw-desktop dist:mac:x64
# Run the following on Windows:
pnpm --filter 9gclaw-desktop dist:win
```

Local macOS builds can use ad-hoc signing. Set
`PILOTDECK_DESKTOP_REQUIRE_SIGNING=1` to enforce production signing locally.

When a root or UI dependency used by the desktop runtime changes, update
`apps/desktop/runtime/package.json`, then refresh its dedicated lockfile with:

```bash
pnpm --dir apps/desktop/runtime install --lockfile-only --ignore-workspace
```

The desktop build fails if the runtime manifest no longer matches the root and
UI manifests, or if its committed lockfile is stale.

## Recovery

If one architecture or platform fails, fix the credential or build issue and
rerun the failed workflow. A release is created only after both macOS DMGs and
the Windows installer are downloaded and verified. For a deliberate additional
release on the same Shanghai date, leave revision empty to select the next
available `-rN` tag automatically.
